## Introduction
A good hackathon is not just about the venue, prizes or food, but also the experience itself. However, it is not easy to provide a consistent experience among 500+ attendees, and having a website that allows hackathon participants to interact with the organizers seamlessly can provide a tremendous boost to the overall hackathon experience.

## What It Does
Live-McHacks contains two main components — a site for participants and an admin panel.

The site for participants, aka the “main site”, acts as a communication portal between participants and organizers. It contains information, such as a schedule, a real-time announcement system and a mentor request system, that is vital for the hackathon to proceed smoothly.

The admin panel, on the other hand, provides organizers and mentors a way to make announcements and attend to mentor requests. It also contains a fail-safe mechanism that allows administrators to force reload the webpage on every client’s computer in the event of an update.

## Technology
We built Live-McHacks by forking HackUCI's github repo [https://github.com/hackuci/live] They built the site using Twitter’s Bootstrap framework and jQuery. They also used Firebase as a real-time database that streams information from the admin panel to the main site and vice versa. We adapted both of these things and added more information to support API information, additional schedule information, but the majority of the site we owe to the hackers that helped setup live.hackuci :)
